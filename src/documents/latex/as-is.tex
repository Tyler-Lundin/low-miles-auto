\section*{As-Is Disclosure}
I understand that most used vehicles are sold \textbf{AS-IS, NO WARRANTY}. This means the dealer does not provide any warranty for the vehicle. Any repairs needed after purchase will be my responsibility. I have been given the opportunity to have the vehicle inspected by a third-party mechanic of my choice before purchase.

\section*{Odometer Disclosure Acknowledgment}
I understand that a federally required Odometer Disclosure Statement will be part of the final sale paperwork. The dealer will certify the mileage of the vehicle to the best of their knowledge.

For Vehicle (VIN): \hrulefill \\
The current mileage is: \hrulefill

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\checkbox] I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge the odometer reading reflects the \textbf{actual mileage}.
    \item[\checkbox] I hereby certify that the odometer reading is \textbf{not the actual mileage (Warning - Odometer Discrepancy)}.
\end{itemize}
